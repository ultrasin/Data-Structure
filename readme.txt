This solution has examples of c++ exercises I've seen so far in a month - from classes, objects, constructors and data 
structures; linear and non linear, dynamic and static.
My main language is Spanish so it may have different meanings or declarations of functions. Hopefully, this project could
help other people to identify and build their own applications or even help with homework. Feel free to clone, modify
this repo at will. Don't forget to give proper credits. - ultra
